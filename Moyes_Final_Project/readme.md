This is an analysis on the data set HistoricalProductDemand.csv.
I was acquired from Kaggle.com.
I have plotted two years of order demand data of the most popular product - "Product_1359."
Some of the item data types had to be changed in order to carry out the analysis.
The final product is of weekly averages of the product. 
A few lines of code were adapted from kashdotten (Kaggle.com).These are notified in the comments in the notebook.
